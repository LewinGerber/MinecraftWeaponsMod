# ⚔ Minecraft Weapons Mod

This is the official page of the Minecraft weapons mod. 
This is a small Minecraft Modification which implements
multiple different items to create more fun PVP battles.
We don't follow a specific theme when creating new items 
and just have fun with it.

### 🔫 WEAPONS:
  - **Arrow Thrower** - throws arrows like a bow but a lot harder
